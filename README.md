# girocheckout_SDK
PHP development SDK for connections to GiroCheckout Payment Gateway

The GiroCockpit SDK allows a simple implementation of the GiroCheckout API. The SDK includes all API calls provided by GiroCheckout. 
For every API there is an example script in the examples section.

Requirements

- The SDK uses the cURL extension for server communication.
- All data must be given in UTF-8. The SDK does not take care of the conversion.
- PHP >= 5.2
